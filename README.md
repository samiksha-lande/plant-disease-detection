# Plant Disease Detection using CNN (MobileNetV2)

This project detects plant leaf diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network (MobileNetV2) with transfer learning.

## Features
- Preprocessing and data augmentation
- Model training using MobileNetV2
- Streamlit web app to upload a leaf image and get predictions

## Technologies
- Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Streamlit

## How to Run
1. (Optional) Train the model using the code in `src/`
2. Run the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
